# Pro4 Predictive Purchasing Pitch
## Presented by: Computational Success Consulting

As a competative online retailer, Pro4 is always looking for ways to improve their customer experience. One of the most common ways to improve customer experience is to recommend products that are likely to be purchased again by customers who return to the site.

We at Computational Success Consulting have been tasked with creating a machine learning model to recommend products that are within purchasing trends through Predictive Modeling and Data Visualization (Tableau). CSC is here to help you with your data science needs to help you improve your customer experience, increase sales, an guide returning customers to products they didn't know they needed, and ultimately, grow your business.
