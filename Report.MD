# Business Report: Predictive Purchasing Model for Pro4 Online Retailer

## Introduction

Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into distinct groups based on shared characteristics, behaviors, and preferences. The purpose of customer segmentation is to better understand the value, characteristics, needs, and behaviors of different customer segments. This understanding can inform and optimize marketing strategies, customer engagement, and product development efforts.

By segmenting customers, businesses can tailor their offerings, messaging, and interactions to meet the specific needs and preferences of each segment more effectively. This targeted approach leads to improved customer satisfaction, increased customer loyalty, and ultimately, higher revenue and profitability.

## Executive Summary

Computational Success Consulting (CSC) has developed a predictive purchasing model for Pro4, an online retailer, to improve customer experience and increase sales. The model leverages machine learning techniques to analyze customer purchasing patterns and recommend products that customers are likely to buy based on their previous purchases.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project were:

1. Analyze customer purchasing data to identify trends and patterns.
2. Develop a machine learning model to predict products that customers are likely to purchase based on their previous purchases.
3. Provide data visualizations to help Pro4 understand customer behavior and purchasing patterns.

## Methodology

The project followed a structured approach, which included the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: The customer segmentation dataset from Kaggle was cleaned, preprocessed, and transformed into a suitable format for analysis using Python, Pandas, and scikit-learn (sklearn).
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Pandas and Matplotlib were used to perform EDA, identifying patterns, trends, and potential correlations within the data.
3. **Customer Segmentation**: Customers were segmented using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value) analysis method, a data-driven approach that helps businesses segment customers and predict their future behavior. This analysis resulted in the identification of segments such as "At Risk," "Average," "Champions," "Gone Customers," and "Loyal Customers."

4. **Model Development**: Various machine learning algorithms from sklearn and TensorFlow were evaluated, including the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) Classification algorithm. The `KNN model` was trained to classify customers into `"Low Value" (0)` and `"Mid to High Value" (1)` segments based on their purchasing behavior and other relevant features.
5. **Model Evaluation**: The `KNN model` achieved an overall accuracy of `86.63%` in classifying customers into the `"Low Value"` and `"Mid to High Value"` segments.
6. **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib was used to create interactive visualizations, providing insights into customer behavior and purchasing patterns.

## Key Findings

The analysis and modeling efforts yielded the following key findings:

1. **Customer Segmentation**: Customers were segmented based on their purchasing behavior, demographics, and other relevant factors, allowing for targeted product recommendations.
2. **Frequent Purchase Patterns**: The model identified products that are frequently purchased together, enabling Pro4 to bundle or cross-sell these items effectively.
3. **High-Value Customers**: The analysis revealed customer segments with high lifetime value, allowing Pro4 to focus marketing efforts on retaining and nurturing these valuable customers.
4. **Low-Value vs Mid/High-Value Customers**: The KNN model successfully classified customers into `"Low Value"` and `"Mid to High Value"` segments with an overall accuracy of `86.63%`.

## Recommendations

Based on the findings, CSC recommends the following actions for Pro4:

1. **Implement the Predictive Purchasing Model**: Integrate the developed machine learning model into Pro4's e-commerce platform to provide personalized product recommendations to customers.
2. **Leverage Data Visualizations**: Utilize the interactive visualizations created with Matplotlib and Tableau to gain insights into customer behavior, identify opportunities for targeted marketing campaigns, and optimize product offerings.
3. **Continuous Model Improvement**: Regularly update the model with new customer data to ensure accurate and up-to-date predictions, and explore opportunities for further model enhancements using the latest techniques and libraries.
4. **Targeted Marketing Strategies**: Develop targeted marketing strategies for each customer segment identified through the RFM analysis, focusing on retaining valuable customers and re-engaging inactive or at-risk customers.

## Conclusion

The predictive purchasing model, customer segmentation analysis, and data visualizations developed by CSC provide Pro4 with valuable insights and tools to enhance customer experience, increase sales, and drive business growth. By leveraging these solutions, Pro4 can stay ahead of the competition and deliver a personalized and engaging shopping experience to its customers.
